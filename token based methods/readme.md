Here is our process:

1. We combine the sentence to a long string, and add two * symbols in the head and tail of the sentence separately.

2. We use the 3-grams method to split the string into many three-character pieces and set these pieces into a list.

3. We calculate the overlap coefficient, Jaccard coefficient, and Dice's coefficient.

4. We would compare the similarity of these lists using the overlap coefficient, Jaccard coefficient, and Dice's coefficient.
